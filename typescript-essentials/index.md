## Reflections üí≠
1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**: I've learnt that TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript with static type checking. It's beneficial to use TS, because it helps to eliminate many of the runtime bugs, because it checks types at compile time. With compile-time checking, it becomes easies to maitain large codebases.
2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**: I've learnt how to associate types with variables through explicit type annotations and implicit type inference. I've learnt that there are a few types: primitive and object types, as well as union and intersection types that allow to declare types more flexibly.
3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**: I've learn what inerfaces are and how they can be used to describe object properties and also arrays and functions. Also, interfaces can be extended which is quite similar to class inheritance and can help to avoid code duplication in relevant interfaces.
4. **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**: I've learnt how to use types in functions and also how to declare types for functions using type aliases and interfaces. I find using types in functions especially useful as it allows to narrow the range of excepting values and also makes the input of function parameters more controlled.
5. **Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript**: I've learnt how to use types in classes. One extremely important TS feature for classes is access modifiers (public, protected, private) that allow to implement the principle of encapsulation. Moreover, interfaces can be used to describe class shape.
6. **Generics in TypeScript**: I've learnt about generics and how they can be used to create generic functions, interfaces and classes. Also, I explored the concept of generic contraints that allow to narrow types that type parameters can accept. It was interesting to know that generics are best used for operations that can be made with different data.
7. **Work with External Libraries in TypeScript**: I've learnt how to work with libraries and modules in TS. Also, I've discovered DefinitelyTyped library that provides type declarations for different external libraries.
8. **Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript**: I've learnt about the concept of namespaces in TS and how to use them to decrease global scope pollution. Also, I've explored the difference between modules and namespaces. Personally, I think that I will use modules more, because the syntax is more clear and modules are a native JS feature.

To sum up, I enjoyed learning TypeScript a lot and I believe that, though it takes more time to write in TypeScript and organise code, it is a great invesment in code quality and reliability. 
With strict type checking, you can always be sure what values are expected, so you are protected from bugs that may happen due to inattention.
Moreover, with Typescript you receive better IntelliSense, which makes coding more smooth and efficient.
