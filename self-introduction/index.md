Hi there!

My name is Olga. I’m a Junior Frontend Developer from Minsk, Belarus. 

Speaking about my education, I have a bachelor degree in Chinese philology at Belarusian State University.

Currently I am taking the RS School Front-end course. My purpose of joining RS School is to find a dream job that will be interesting, challenging and that will bring me joy and self-fulfillment. By the way, I have already participated in the course before, but I, unfortunately, didn’t have enough knowledge and time to complete it.

As for now, I feel confident at the learning process and I manage to complete tasks on time. Also, I’m super motivated to study, because soon I’ll finish working for a university distribution and I will eventually have an opportunity to find a job in the sphere that I’m really fond of.

For now, my technology stack includes semantic HTML, adaptive, responsive and cross-browser CSS and SCSS, Vaniila JS, also Typescript, git and webpack. Also, I’ve tried coding in React JS and liked it a lot. I’m really eager to learn new things, new concepts and master new technologies, and actually I enjoy the learning process itself a lot. For now, my top priority is to deeply explore Core JS, learn Typescript and React framework. 

Speaking about recent tasks, few of them were quite challenging for me. 

First of all, there was a task called Nonograms. The main complexity was that the required functionality was very rich. It included game logics, game timer, saving and restoring game state, having dark and light theme and even more. Additionally, I’ve learnt about native Web Components in JS and I tried to use them in this task. It was quite a challenge, because first of all, it was a new technology for me and also it had a lot of nuances in working with Shadow DOM, in reaching elements in Shadow DOM and in styling Shadow DOM, so it was quite a bunch of new things to learn and explore. Eventually, I managed to implement all the required functionality of the app. I feel, of course, like my code needs some refactoring, but generally I’m really happy with the result.

Also, there was a task called core-js-conditions-n-loops-tasks, which seemed to be rather simple at first. It included several tasks to write functions using conditions and loops to practice with these things. And though it seemed really simple at first, eventually it made me puzzle a lot because the last few tasks required not only thinking of algorithm and solution of this task, but also about optimization of functions to take large amounts of data and process it in quite a small amount of time. Moreover, the usage of array and string methods was forbidden in this task, which was really unusual for me. And it was really difficult without these methods, because I’m used to using them in coding and I couldn’t use them there. But with some advice from Discord chat, I managed to complete this task successfully.

Summing everything up, I’m a highly motivated student who enjoys studying and coding. I’m really eager to study JS in-depth and learn best practices to code thoughtfully. 

Thanks for your attention and good luck to all of us in our further training! Good bye!
