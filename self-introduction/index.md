Hi there!
My name is Olga. I’m a Junior Frontend Developer from Minsk, Belarus. 

I have a bachelor degree in Chinese philology at Belarusian State University.

Currently I am taking the RS School Front-end course. My purpose of joining RS School is to find a dream job that will be interesting, challenging and that will bring me joy and self-fulfillment. By the way, I have already participated in the course before, but didn’t have enough knowledge and time to complete it.

As for now, I feel confident at the learning process and manage to complete tasks on time. Also, I’m super motivated to study, because soon I’ll finish working for a university distribution and will have an opportunity to find a job in the sphere, I’m fond of.

For now, my technology stack includes semantic HTML, adaptive and responsive CSS and SCSS, Vaniila JS, git, webpack and Typescript. Also, I’ve tried coding in React JS. I’m really eager to learn new concepts and master new technologies, and actually I enjoy learning process a lot. My top priority for now is to deeply explore Core JS, learn Typescript and React framework. 

Speaking about the recent tasks, few of them were quite challenging. 

First of all, there was a task Nonograms. The main complexity was that the required functionality was quite rich, including game logics, game timer, saving and restoring game, having dark and light theme and more. Additionally, I’ve learnt about native Web Component and tried to use them in this task. It was quite a challenge, because there are a lot of nuances in styling Shadow DOM and reaching components in it. Eventually, I managed to implement all the required functionality for this app. I feel like my code needs refactoring, but generally I’m happy with the result.

Also, there was a task called core-js-conditions-n-loops-tasks, which seemed to be rather simple at first, but the last few tasks made me puzzle a lot, because some of them involved not only thinking of solution, but also thinking of optimization of the function for large amounts of data. Moreover, the usage of array and string methods was forbidden, which was really unusual. With the advice from Discord chat, I managed to complete the task successfully.

Summing up, I’m a highly motivated student who enjoys studying and coding. I’m really eager to study JS in-depth and learn best practices to code thoughtfully. 

Thanks for attention and good luck to all of us in further training! Bye!
